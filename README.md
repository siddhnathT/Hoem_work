Vault Contract
Overview
The Vault Contract is a Move-based smart contract deployed on the Aptos blockchain. It provides functionalities to manage a vault, including depositing tokens, allocating tokens to addresses, claiming allocated tokens, and withdrawing tokens. This README will guide you through the setup, deployment, and usage of the contract.

Project Structure
Move.toml: Configuration file for the Move package.
vault.move: The Move smart contract source file.
README.md: This documentation file.
Prerequisites
Aptos CLI: Ensure you have the Aptos CLI installed. Install Aptos CLI.
Aptos Account: Create an Aptos account and fund it with tokens. Create an Account.
Welldone Wallet: Use Welldone Wallet for interaction with Aptos. Welldone Wallet.
Configuration
Update your Move.toml file with the following details:

toml
Copy code
[package]
name = "vault_contract"
version = "1.0.0"
authors = []

[addresses]
the_vault = "<your-vault-address>"

[dev-addresses]

[dependencies.AptosFramework]
git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core.git"
rev = "mainnet"
subdir = "aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework"

[dev-dependencies]
Replace <your-vault-address> with the address of your deployed vault contract.

Deployment
Deploy the Contract
Navigate to the Contract Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd <path-to-your-contract>
Deploy Using Aptos CLI:

bash
Copy code
aptos move publish --package-dir <path-to-your-package>
Note the address where your contract is deployed.

Initialize the Vault
Initialize the Vault:

bash
Copy code
aptos move run --function "work::vault::init_module" --args <admin-address>
Replace <admin-address> with your Aptos account address.

Usage
Deposit Tokens
Deposit Tokens into the Vault:

bash
Copy code
aptos move run --function "work::vault::deposit_tokens" --args <admin-address> <vault-address> <amount>
Replace <admin-address>, <vault-address>, and <amount> with appropriate values.

Allocate Tokens
Allocate Tokens to a Test Address:

bash
Copy code
aptos move run --function "work::vault::allocate_tokens" --args <admin-address> <vault-address> <test-address> <amount>
Replace <admin-address>, <vault-address>, <test-address>, and <amount> with appropriate values.

Attempt Allocation from a Non-Admin Address:

bash
Copy code
aptos move run --function "work::vault::allocate_tokens" --args <non-admin-address> <vault-address> <test-address> <amount>
Ensure <non-admin-address> is not the admin address.

Claim Tokens
Claim Allocated Tokens:

bash
Copy code
aptos move run --function "work::vault::claim_tokens" --args <test-address> <vault-address>
Replace <test-address> and <vault-address> with appropriate values.

Withdraw Tokens
Withdraw Unallocated Tokens:

bash
Copy code
aptos move run --function "work::vault::withdraw_tokens" --args <admin-address> <vault-address> <amount>
Replace <admin-address>, <vault-address>, and <amount> with appropriate values.

Testing
Test the Contract's Functionality:

Verify that the init_module function initializes the vault correctly.
Ensure tokens can be deposited using deposit_tokens.
Allocate tokens and verify using allocate_tokens.
Confirm that non-admin addresses cannot allocate tokens.
Test claiming tokens with claim_tokens.
Withdraw tokens using withdraw_tokens.
Error Handling:

Verify that errors are handled correctly, such as insufficient balance or unauthorized access.
